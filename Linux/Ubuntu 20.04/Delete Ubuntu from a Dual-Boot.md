# Delete Ubuntu from Windows 10 dual boot

## Delete Ubuntu Partition (data)

1. Back up files from ubuntu partitition.
1. Sign into windows. Open disk management and deallocate Ubuntu partitionâ€™s space.
1. With this, ubuntu has been successfully removed.

## Reorder Boot Order

Boot into UEFI Firmware interface. For me, I can enter the firmware interface by pressing on `F2` while booting. You need to check with your manufacturer's website to find out how to enter this interface. It's usally one of `F1, F2, F8, F9`.<br>
Reorder Windows boot as higher priority than grub.

## Removing GRUB

### Option A: Using windows recovery drive

1. Boot using the recovery drive.
1. Choose Troubleshoot --> Choose Command Prompt. Run the following commands
>```
	run bootrec.exe /fixmbr
	restart
	```

1. If that doesn't work, try using automatic repair
> Automatic repair is the option with the `settings-icon`
	
### Option B: Manually fixing EFI partition (Preferrable)

1. Run cmd.exe using administrator priviliges.
1. Run `diskpart` and list all disks (hard-disk)
	
		diskpart	
		list disk
1. Assign a partition letter to the UEFI volume (partition). 
> Select the disk where UEFI is installed. <br>
> Select the UEFI volume. <br>
> Here, I assign the volume the partition letter of `Z:`. <br> 
> Then, exit `diskpart`.
	
		sel disk <num>
		list vol
		sel vol <num>
		assign letter=<letter>
			-- sel disk 0
			-- sel vol 5
			-- assign letter=Z (ensure that letter is unused by other partitions)
		exit
		
1. Now access the contents of the Ubuntu partition and remove the following
>	- GRUB
>	- initramfs files (kernel images)			
		
		Z:							// switches to Z:
		dir							// list directories
		cd EFI
		rmdir /S ubuntu				// Delete ubuntu grub
		
		del /f <initramfs files> 	// deletes the initramfs files, located probably in EFI

1. Finally, remove the asigned letter to the UEFI partition
	
		diskpart
		list disk
		
		sel disk <num> (same num as last time)
		sel vol <num> (same num as last time)
		remove letter=<letter> (same letter as last time)
			
		//For me, I execute the following commands
		sel disk 0
		sel vol 5
		remove letter=Z
