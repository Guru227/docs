--- Git Locations ---

There are multiple places of data store in Git. The 4 important places are:
	1. Working Tree - location on yout computer that contains the directories
and files of a single commit. This is where you can edit and view files preparing 
for next commit.
	2. Staging Area/Index - lists of files that are planned for next commit
	3. Local Repository - Contains all commits of the project
NOTE: The working tree and the .git file (which contains the staging area and 
the local repository) form what is called the project directory.
	4.Remote Repository - Often hosted on the cloud or a datacentre and is 
the official state of the project.
