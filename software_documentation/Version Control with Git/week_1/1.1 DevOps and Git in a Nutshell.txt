--- DevOps and Git in a Nutshell ---

1. Continuous improvement
Key priniciple of DevOps is continuously plan, build and release small improvements
to your product, in contrast to a waterfall approach (released as a batch).
This is the reason for continuous improvements (bug fixes and feature releases).

2. Managing Project Versions
Commits (versions) form a project history and is an entire snapshot of the project.
Commits remember only that which has been modified. Each unique file is stored only once.
Commits (versions) can be reviewed and undo-ed.

3. Branches
All commits belong to a branch.
A branch is an independent line of development.
Default main branch AKA master.
Uses:
	Does not disrupt master branch stability.
	Branch independence 
		- allows teams to work on seperate, mutually-exclusive development

4. Pull Requests
Branches can be merged into master branch (or any other branch).
Request to merge AKA pull request.
	Team members can discuss, review, and approve changes
	Pass automated tests
