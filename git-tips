# setting up git
you need to set username and email

`git config --global user.name "<yourName>"`
`git config --global user.email "<yourEmailID>"`

# to store your password, the git credentials manager comes in handy
here I enable it globally

`git config --global credential.helper store`

After enabling it globally, the first time you pull or push from remote Git, you will be asked for a username and password, after which you will not.
