---Setting up a multi-node cluster ---

# 3.5 Create and distribute RSA keys ---

1. Ensure pdsh and ssh is installed. If not install with the folowing commands
	```
	sudo apt-get install pdsh
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	```

2. Edit ~/.bashrc
> The RCMD type of the pdsh connection is set to ssh everytime you open bash. Run the following command to set it. <br>
> 
`echo "export PDSH_RCMD_TYPE=ssh" >> ~/.bashrc`

3. Run the following commands to generate an SSH key for the master and distribute the public keys to the slaves.
> In Master node
	```
	ssh-keygen -t rsa 
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user1@hadoop-master 
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user2@hadoop-slave-1 
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user3@hadoop-slave-2 
	```
> In Master and Slave nodes	
	```
	chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys	//seting access permission to only readable and executable
	```
>
> **NOTE:** You can access each slave (node) by SSH-ing into it with the following command.
	```
	ssh slave_name
	```
