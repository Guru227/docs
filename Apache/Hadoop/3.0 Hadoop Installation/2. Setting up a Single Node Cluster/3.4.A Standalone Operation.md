--- Setting up a Single Node Cluster ---

# 3.4A Standalone operation

By default, Hadoop is configured to run in a non-distributed mode, as a single Java process. This is useful for debugging. <br>

The following example copies the unpacked conf directory, uses it as an input, searches every match of the given regular expression (dfs...) and finally, displays the output. The output is written in the given output directory.
```
	cd /opt/hadoop
	mkdir etc/hadoop/*.xml input
	hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.2.1.jar grep input output 'dfs[a-z.]+'
	cat output/*
```

**NOTE:** None of the configuration files need to be set.
