# 3.3 Setting up ssh and pdsh

Although ssh is not necessary for standalone operation, it is required for pseudo-distributed operation and a cluster setup.

1. Check if ssh (ssh remote login client) and pdsh (issues commands to group of hosts in parallel) is installed
> `ssh -V && pdsh -V	//Check if versions are returned`

1. If its not installed, install ssh and pdsh
> `sudo apt-get install ssh` <br>
> `sudo apt-get install pdsh`
	
1. Verify if ssh server is running:
> `which sshd		//active if it returns path of ssh daemon` <br>
> **OR** <br>
> `sudo systemctl status ssh 		//active if it returns "ssh.service: ... active"`
	
1. To check if that worked, try ssh-ing into localhost
> `ssh localhost` <br>
> <br>
> You should get the following:
> ```	
	...	
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes	
	...
	Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ...
	...
```

1. Exit this superfluous self-connection by executing the following command
> `exit`
	
1. Change rcmd type of pdsh connection from rsh to ssh
> `export PDSH_RCMD_TYPE=ssh`<br>
> `pdsh -q -w localhost		//to verify if rcmd_type is ssh`<br>
> <br> 
> Or you could just add that statement to *~/.bashrc* to set RCMD type as ssh everytime you open the terminal. To add it, execute the following command:
> `echo 'export PDSH_RCMD_TYPE=ssh' >> ~/.bashrc`

1. Create a rsa public-private keypair without a passphrase in the default location (if you haven't already)
> **Either ** execute the following command and repeatedly hit enter until everything is done <br>
> `ssh-keygen` <br>
> <br>
> **OR ** execute the following: <br>
> `ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

1. Append public key of generated pair to authorized keys and set user permissions read-only
> `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` <br>
> `chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
