--- 1.2 Database terminologies: partitioning ---

Database tables can be partitioned in two ways:
1. Vertical partitioning:
	Stores tables and/or columns in seperate tables/databases.
2. Horizontal partitioning (sharding):
	Stores rows of a table in multiple database clusters, making it easier for cluster 
	computing (distributed computing). Sharding is needed if a dataset is too large to be 
	stored in a single DB. Most importantly, sharding allows a DB to scale in line with its 
	data growth. It also reduces table size (index size more specifically) which improves 
	performance.	
Pros:
	Scalability (same code can now be utilised for unlimited number of shards, irrespective of 
	how many are there), increased speed for large database
Cons:
	Makes programming and operations more convoluted
