# 1.0 How do VPNs work - Introduction

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a simple software that was created to protect your online privacy by making your traffic and location anonymous. It can also be used to access geo-blocked streaming services, downloading torrents faster and more.

## 1.1 What can a VPN do?

1. VPNs encrypt all the data you send over the internet.
    - When connected to a VPN server, all your internet traffic is encrypted. 
    - Your ISP cannot throttle your speeds (which it oftens does if you're doing something speed-intensive like streaming or gaming).

2. Masks you IP address
    - You IP address is used to determine location by some services (Netflix). When connected to a VPN server, they see only the VPN's Ip address.

3. Some VPNs block malicious websites, ads and trackers.

## 1.2 How do VPNs work?

1. Your VPN encrypts then directs all of your internet traffic to one of its server.
2. Then, your VPN forwards the traffic to the website you're visiting. The site can only see your VPN's IP and not yours. The best VPNs use thousands of IP, which are updated regularly, so sites don't have time to blacklist them. This way, you stay private and undetectable. 

## 1.3 Are VPNs legal?

You can freely use VPNs in most countries, but some countires like China and Iraq forbid the use of non-governmental VPNs. This makes such providers likely to comply with anti-privacy and censorship requirements making them untrustworthy.

## 1.4 How does a VPN guarantee my privacy?

Reliable VPNs are built having solid privacy policies and strong security measures and usually have the following characteristics:

1. No-logs policies

Tough anti-logging plolicies prevent VPN providers from recording your browsing activity.

2. DNS leak protection

DNS resolution usually happens through your ISPs DNS server, which can be used to reveal your browsing history. BUt when connected to a VPN, you route your traffic through the VPNs DNS server. Sometimes, your device can route it through the ISPs DNS, but the VPN ensures that this does not happen.

3. IPv6 Leak Protection

Most VPNs use IPv4 addresses exclusively. In the case where your ISP supports IPv6 and you access a website that also supports it, then your traffic will be routed thorugh your ISP, whcih will compromise on your privacy.

Trustworthy VPNs disable IPv6 traffic to prtect you from these leaks. You access such IPv6 enabled websites using VPNs IPv4 addresses.

4. WebRTC Leak Protection

Leading browsers use WebRTC technology to communicate with each other. To do this, they need to each other's real IP address. The techniques they use to get this information are more advanced, so its harder to hide your IP from them. Third parties can exploit WebRTC to find out your identity (IP address and location).

A trustworthy VPN will disable WebRTC and shield your IP address.

## 1.5 Negatives to using VPN

1. Your connection speed will reduce

Due to encrytion, and rerouting through VPN servers

2. Untrusworthy VPNs could have access to your browsing activity

A less reputable provider might have access to your browsing activity, and may even be forced to share this information with government.

You can protect yourself against this by using a well-known, reputable VPN with a strict no-logs policy and RAM-based servers. RAM based servers delete information everytime they are rebooted, so your VPN won't have any information to share.

3. Some websites block VPN users

4. PayPal and some online banks may flag a security breach on your account if you log in from a foreign IP.

## 1.6 What do I look for in a VPN?

1. 256 bit encryption - this is the highest level of encryption available.
2. An automatic kill-switch - Kill switches kick in and temporarily disconnect you from the internet when the connection becomes unstable.
3. A strict no-logs policy
4. AD and IPv6 leak protection
5. Customer SUpport - Most premium VPNs offer live chat on their sites (very few offer phone services).
6. User-firendly apps
7. Large server coverage - from many countries around the world.
8. Streaming and P2P-optimized servers
9. Multiple simultaneous connections - from multiple devices without having to sign up for multiple VPN subscriptions.
