# Internet Protocol Suite

The internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols usind in the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundation protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol.

The internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetised, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organised into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved.From lowest to highest, they are:

1. **Link Layer:** containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment.
2. **Internet Layer:** providing internetworking between independent networks
3. **Transport Layer:** handling host-to-host communication
4. **Application Layer:** providing process-to-process data exchange for applications
