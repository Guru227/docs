# End-to-end principle

The end-to-end priniciple is a design framework in computer netowrking. In networks designed according to this principle, application specific features reside in the communicating end nodes of the network, rather than in intermediary nodes, such as gateways and routers.
	
The end-to-end principle is closely related, and sometimes seen as direct precursor, to the principle of net neutrality.
	
## The Underlying idea

The fundamental notion behind the end-to-end principle is that for two processes communicating with each other via some communication means, the reliability obtained from that means cannot be expected to be perfectly aligned with the reliability requirements of the processes
