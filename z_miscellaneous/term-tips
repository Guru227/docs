# search packages using apt

to search global repo
`apt search [keyword]`

to search local repo
`apt file-search [keyword]`

to search within man page
1. open man page
2. type regex beginning with `/`
3. use `n` and `p` to navigate between matches
4. `esc` to end match or `/` to start a nwe regex

you can do a lot more stuff like testing a command with the man page and searching commands you do not know the name of.
